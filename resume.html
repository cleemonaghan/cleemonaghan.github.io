                    <p>This course was an introduction to computer science and programming. 
                     The programming language Java was used to illustrate object-oriented programming and other concepts. 
                     The course emphasized the use of the computer as a problem-solving tool and the development of good programming style.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>CS 261: Computer Science II</h4>
                    <p>This course was a continuation of CSCI 161. It provided an introduction to the study of fundamental data structures
                        and their associated algorithms. We learned how to choose appropriate data structures and algorithms for particular 
                        problems. The course covered the concepts of lists, stacks, queues, trees, sorting, searching, abstract 
                        data types, and object-oriented programming using an object-oriented programming language.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>CS 281: Assembly Language and Computer Architecture</h4>
                    <p>This course was our introduction to machine organization, machine structure, 
                        data representation, digital logic, and assembly language programming on a RISC based architecture.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>CS 291: Programming Language Paradigms</h4>
                    <p>This course introduced the declarative, functional, dataflow, and logic programming paradigms in depth 
                        through assignments in the programming languages Haskell and Prolog. 
                        Exposure to languages are fundamentally different from 
                        the von Neumann model underlying imperative programming languages provided valuable 
                        perspective on programming and problem solving in general.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>CS 315: Computer Graphics</h4>

                        The emphasis was on the design and use of graphical facilities for two- and three-dimensional graphics. 
                        We reviewed the calculus and linear algebra underlying computer generated graphics, and implemented programs 
                        utilizing these techniques. The mathematical topics covered include rotations, translations, and perspective. 
                        The core pieces of the graphics pipeline used in current graphics hardware are studied.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>CS 475: Operating Systems</h4>
                    <p>This course traceed how the simple idea of "resource sharing" unravels into some of the most 
                        confounding problems and original breakthroughs in computer science. Course topics included 
                        process and thread management, input/output, CPU scheduling, synchronization primitives, 
                        memory management, and file systems. We learned how to deal with the intricacies of low-level
                        programming, parallel computing and synchronization problems, and also received kernel-development
                        experience through the design and implementation of various subsystems in a real operating system. 
                        The C programming language was used in this course for assignments and projects.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>CS 361: Algorithms and Data Structures</h4>
                    <p>This course explored advanced data structures, the algorithms needed to manipulate these
                         data structures, proofs that the algorithms are correct, and a runtime analysis of the algorithms. 
                         We studied advanced data structures such as Rede-Black rees, 2-3 Trees, Heaps, and Graphs. 
                         Additionally, we studied algorithm design techniques including Greedy Algorithms, 
                         Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, and the NP-Complete problem.</p>
                </li>

                    <p>This course introduced the student to the techniques of artificial intelligence. 
                        Students learned strategies for uninformed and informed (heuristic) searches, 
                        knowledge representation, problem-solving, and machine learning. Additional topics included 
                        probabilistic reasoning, and philosophical implications.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>CS 240: Software Engineering</h4>
                    <p>This course introduces us to the design and implementation of large software systems. 
                        Topics included design methodologies, programming team organization, and management,

                <li><h4>CS 425: Natural Language Processing</h4>
                    <p>This is a special projects course in artificial intelligence with an emphasis on natural language processing. 
                        This includes both understanding and generating text. The purpose of this course is to familiarize students 
                        with the algorithms and techniques commonly used in the field of natural language processing and to 
                        provide hands-on practice building an NLP system that can play (and hopefully complete) a text-based game.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>CS 455: Principles of Database Systems</h4>
                    <p>This course centers around the fundamental concepts and theory that underpin the relational 
                        data model, which addresses numerous problems that plague data management, including 
                        data independence, consistency, information loss, and access performance. 
                        Course topics include the relational data model, database languages (e.g., SQL), 
                        relational database theory, database design (by decomposition), query execution, 
                        and considerations that affect system performance. 
                        During this course we will design database schemas that effectively model an organization's 
                        information requirements and write programs that require database integration.</p>
