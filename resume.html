Experience:  A title and a short one-paragraph synopsis per item will be sufficient per item.
Coursework: List your CS and CS-adjacent (such as Math) courses here. Use an unordered list containing course number and course title.
Technical Projects: List any significant technical projects here. A title and short one-paragraph synopsis per project will be sufficient. Since itâ€™s so early in your studies, you can just list some CS 1 or CS 2 projects here.
Affiliations: List any academic clubs you might be a part of, including athletics and Greek life.
