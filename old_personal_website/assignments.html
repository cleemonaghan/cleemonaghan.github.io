                                    I am really proud of how my app looks. There are

                                    screens I need to create, but it looks much more professional
                                    than I expected it to look.

                                    Earlier in the week, I spent a lot of time creating a personal website from scratch. 
                                    Then after I had finished building the framework for it, I looked into bulma and realized I could 
                                    make my site look much nicer using the bulma CSS, so after I recreated my personal website with Bulma, 
                                    it felt like all the work I had put in before was wasted.

                                    I thought your lectures this week were very helpful. 
                                    I liked how you split the lecture up into titled sub-sections, then if 
                                    I needed to go back and get a refresher, I knew which video to watch.

                                    Since I am realitively familiar with python, I spent 
                                    more time researching interships than working on classwork.
                                     I enjoyed the primes, prime_factorization, my_sort and 
                                     encrpytion assignments, especially since they drew on 
                                     topics that I had a backgroun in, so I could add my own 
                                     little twist to them or take them a few steps further.
                                </p>

                                    Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of the choose 
                                    your own adventure assignments. It isn't that 
                                    I don't like the idea, but for an assignment like 
                                    that, I had a harder time coming up with the ideas 
                                    for the "story" and spent less time working on code. 
                                    I think it is a good assignment, but maybe it would be 
                                    better to have it as an optional assignment.
                                </p>

                                    My only recommendation would be to make the choose 
                                    your own adventure assignement optional.
